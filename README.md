# :wrench: Inner Workings of React

This repository is basically just the end result of the code from [this fantastic article series](https://engineering.hexacta.com/didact-learning-how-react-works-by-building-it-from-scratch-51007984e5c5) by [Rodrigo Pombo](https://twitter.com/pomber) about how to build react from scratch.

The only main difference is that I've just added a lot more comments for myself based on what was in the articles.
